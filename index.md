Using Recurrant Neural Networks to Generate and Classify Product Reviews Based on Existing Amazon Data

## Abstract
The purpose of this summer research project is to analyze the correlation between the RNN models that generate and classify text. My goal is to be able to assign a rating (1-5 stars) to the generated reviews based on their classification. 

My first objective is to conduct a literary review in order to better understand RNNs and obtain general knowledge surrounding NLP. 

My second objective is to clean and preprocess the data so it is optimal to use to train and test the RNN models. I will use existing Amazon product reviews. 

My third objective is to create text classification and generation models. The models will be able to generate product reviews and classify them as either positive or negative. I will also analyze the models' accuracy and losses.

Finally, my last objective is to assign a 5-star rating to the generated reviews using the classification model.
