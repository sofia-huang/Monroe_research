Using Recurrant Neural Networks to Generate and Classify Product Reviews Based on Existing Amazon Data

## Abstract
The purpose of this summer research project is to create fake product reviews and determine whether or not they are helpful using text generation and classification.

My first objective is to conduct a literary review in order to better understand current RNN models for processing text and obtain general knowledge surrounding NLP. 

My second objective is to clean and preprocess the data so it is optimal to use to train and test the RNN models. I will use existing Amazon product reviews. 

My third objective is to create text classification and generation models. The models will be able to generate product reviews and classify them as either positive or negative. I will also analyze the models' accuracy and losses.

My fourth objective is to analyze multiple different classification models to predict the helpfulness of a product review and choose the best one.

Finally, my last objective is to assign a 5-star rating to the generated reviews using the classification model and use the best model found to predict whether or not the generated reviews are helpful.
